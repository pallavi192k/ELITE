## ELITE : The Anti-Social Media App 

o Unlike Facebook and Instagram, ELITE is a social media application which allows users to connect within the ELITE community without requiring profiles to have centralized content and friend list. 

o With ELITE, each user can create multiple “ELITEs”. A single elite contains a localized friend list and shared content. Each elite can be categorized in a color coded group, such as friends, families, coworkers etc. No other user will be able to see your elite. 

o Within each elite, a user can participate in a group chat and feed, where they can share images, URLs, and videos for all members to view. 

## Why Use ELITE? 
o Unlike other social media applications, ELITE emphasize and stress the importance of User privacy. 

## Privacy and Intimacy 
o Each user's profile and elite groups are kept private. Users cannot search for other user profiles, or join other elite without admin invitation. 

o Joining ELITE is easy. Only an email and age verification is required, no further information is needed.
